# HaskL

Haskell is a functional programming language. An everything is immutable. Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions. Doesnt have variables. loops and all but have a constant vaariable. Checks for errors only at the compile time.
\

Haskell uses Type Inference - Data Type of variable changes as per type of variable stored.
Statically Typed

-- Int -2^63 to 2^63
-- Integer size as much as memory can hold

-- Float is available but better use Double - 11 precision
-- Bool True or False

-- Char '
-- Tuple
